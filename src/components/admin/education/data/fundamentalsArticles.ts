        <p>
          Appropriate antibiotic selection involves considering the suspected pathogen, site of infection,
          patient factors, and local resistance patterns. Whenever possible, use narrow-spectrum antibiotics
          to minimize microbiome disruption and reduce selective pressure for resistance.

      <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-3">1. Appropriate Antibiotic Selection</h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Choosing the right antibiotic involves considering multiple factors including the suspected pathogen, 
        site of infection, patient factors, and local resistance patterns. Empiric therapy should be guided by 
        the most likely causative organisms for the specific infection being treated.
      </p>
      
      <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-3">2. Spectrum of Activity</h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Antibiotics can be classified as narrow-spectrum or broad-spectrum based on the range of bacteria they 
        target. Whenever possible, narrow-spectrum antibiotics should be preferred to minimize collateral damage 
        to the patient's microbiome and reduce selective pressure that promotes resistance.

      <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-3">3. Route of Administration</h4>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The selection between oral, intravenous, or other routes depends on:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Severity of infection</li>
        <li>Bioavailability of the antibiotic</li>
        <li>Site of infection</li>
        <li>Patient's ability to take oral medications</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mt-6 mb-3">4. Timing and Duration</h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Prompt initiation of antibiotics is critical for severe infections. The duration of therapy should be 
        tailored to the specific infection, with many conditions now requiring shorter courses than previously 
        recommended.

        <p class="mb-2">Recent clinical trials support shorter courses for many common infections:</p>

          <li>Uncomplicated UTI: 3-5 days</li>
          <li>Community-acquired pneumonia: 5-7 days</li>
          <li>Uncomplicated cellulitis: 5-6 days</li>
