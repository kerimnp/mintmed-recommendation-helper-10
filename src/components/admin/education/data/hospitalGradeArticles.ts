- Vancomycin 500mg PO/PR QID
- PLUS metronidazole 500mg IV Q8H
- Surgical consultation
- ICU management

### Recurrent CDI Management
**First Recurrence:**
- Vancomycin 125mg PO QID × 10 days
- Fidaxomicin preferred if available
- Pulse/taper regimens for vancomycin

**Multiple Recurrences:**
- Fidaxomicin 200mg PO BID × 10 days
- Vancomycin pulse/taper regimens
- Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
- Bezlotoxumab (monoclonal antibody)

### Specialized Therapies

#### Fidaxomicin
Advantages:
- Lower recurrence rates
- Narrow spectrum activity
- Preserves normal microbiota
- Effective against epidemic strains

#### Bezlotoxumab
Indications:
- High risk for recurrence
- Age >65 years
- Immunocompromised
- Previous CDI episode

#### Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
Considerations:
- Multiple recurrences
- High cure rates (>90%)
- Various delivery methods
- Donor screening requirements

## Prevention Strategies

### Antimicrobial Stewardship
Core interventions:
